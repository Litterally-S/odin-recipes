                    <h2>Zucchini and Pancakes Topped with Maple Syrup</h2>
                    <p>I really enjoy zucchini, and it's fun to discover new approaches for using it. I mixed my preferred ingredients for zucchini bread, namely cinnamon and vanilla, into a light pancake recipe! If nuts are your thing in fast breads, testing out 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans in the batter cod be worth it.  </p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                            <li>1 cup milk</li>
                            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                            <li>1 large egg</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>1 cup shredded zucchini</li>
                            <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>                              
                        </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add lemon juice to a cup of milk. Set aside until milk starts to curdle, 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
                            <li> Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Pour in curdled milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir with a spoon or whisk until the batter is just combined. Add shredded zucchini and mix until well incorporated. </li>
                            <li> Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned, about 2 more minutes. </li>
                        </ol>
