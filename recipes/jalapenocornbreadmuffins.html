                    <h2>A delicous platefull of Jalapeño Cornbread Muffins</h2>
                    <p>  I love that these jalapeno cornbread muffins combine south-of-the-border flavors from my adopted cuisine, Tex-Mex, with my southern Kentucky roots. Cornbread is so easy to stir up, and this recipe spices it up a little, with the addition of jalapeño, onions, and a little taco seasoning mix for good measure. The recipe makes 12 muffins, but my Hubby had three! </p>

                            <li>  Place 1/4 cup butter in a small skillet and melt. When butter is melted, add onion and minced jalapeño and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. </li>
                            <li><H5>Step 3</H5></li>
                            <li>  In a mixing bowl, combine beaten eggs and buttermilk, stirring briskly to combine.   </li>
                            <li><H5>Step 4</H5></li>

                            <li> Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until dry ingredients are just moistened and there are no lumps. Pour batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Place a slice of jalapeño on top of each muffin. </li>

                            <li> Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. If it does not come out clean, bake about 5 minutes more and test again. </li>
